**This is the directory where I put all of the simple apps that I have developed.** <br><br>
All of the apps that I have created are designed for Android. The minimum API for all of these apps is 21, aka Lollipop. <br>
These apps were made to test out different features that are available in the Android Libraries. <br>
The design of the apps were made for a Samsung Galaxy S9 running on API 28, aka Pie. These apps were also tested on a Google Pixel 2 virtual device.<br><br>
_This class reuses some of @seker 's code because he is the professor and he provides it in his github repository._

<br><br>
**The included apps are:**
- BattleBots
  - This is an app that is meant to play a battle bots game in class. The goal of this app was to use networking to connect to a server and fight other robots who also connected. This was done by having a connect button to type in the address and then with a controller to move your bot around.
- Country_List_RecylerView_With_NavView
  - The purpose of this was to review a recyler view and add the navigation view to help the user go between continents. The list of the countries that one can navigate to is a couple years old. 
- Expense_Tracker
  - This app is used to track the expenses of the user. The user manually puts in the expense and the information regarding it and it gets stored. This application uses the Room database for its method of storage.
