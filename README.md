# Projects that I have worked on

**This repository has multpile projects that I have worked on throughout my years at the University of Wyoming.**
<br>
_If there is any mention of sblair3 in any of my code, it is because sblair3 was my github account which was connected to my school account which will cease to exist. Thus, I have taken my programs from that account and put them here._

**The projects currently included in this repository:**

- Curry_Website
  - This is a MVC website that I had built for one of my classes. It currently is not properly connecting to the Azure SQL database. But it can be run on a local machine. It requires users to login or Oauth with google, and then they can upload curry recipe information.
- Maze
  - This is an application that builds a maze to certain specifications and finds a route through it. I worked on this with @Tuttuhl 
- Merkle_Tree_Code
  - This is a program that implments a merkle tree simulating voter registration. I worked on this with @Tuttuhl @Oyedola and @sgoering
- Mobile_Programs
  - This is directory of multiple small mobile programs I have developed for some of my classes. 
- Simple_Linux_File_System
  - This program was introduced as a way to understand how an file system works. Its main focus was on how does a file system store data and how can that data be accessed. I worked on this with @gbrown15
- Simple_Scheduler
  - This is a program that mimics how an operating system dynamically schedules tasks on a single process system.

**Things that are currently not included in this repository:**
- Software_Design_Of_A_Simple_Game
  - Unfortunately as of right now I am unable to acquire the code for this as my professor owns the copyright of the game.
- Study_Abroad_Mobile_App
  - As this project is being made right now and this app is for an entity, I cannot release the code for it at this time.
