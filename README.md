# Projects that I have worked on

**This repository has multpile projects that I have worked on throughout my years at the University of Wyoming.**

<br>

**The projects currently included in this repository:**

- Simple_Linux_File_System
  - This program was introduced as a way to understand how an file system works. Its main focus was on how does a file system store data and how can that data be accessed. 
- Simple_Scheduler
  - This is a program that mimics how an operating system dynamically schedules tasks on a single process system.

**Things that are currently not included in this repository:**
- Software_Design_Of_A_Simple_Game
  - Unfortunately as of right now I am unable to acquire the code for this as my professor owns the copyright of the game.
- Study_Abroad_Mobile_App
  - As this project is being made right now and this app is for an entity, I cannot release the code for it at this time.
